One of the original patents for 3Dconnextion's SpaceMouse series of products has expired. This one covers one way to
create their optoelectronic mechanism to create a brilliant 6DOF (Degrees Of Freedom) knob.

Here's a copy on [Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20030102426A1/en)


It's remarkably simple. Maybe after I finish my MPCNC I can try milling some circuit boards? That would be a fun
project. I've really wanted a SpaceMouse after I tried using one at the makerspace before the pandemic. The cost is just
way too high for makers and students though (150 USD!), who are generally very price-sensitive.
