The [RepRap Arduino Mega Pololu Shield (RAMPS) 1.4](https://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4) Remains one the most popular
low-cost 3D printer controller boards. I had bought an entire kit recently from Amazon for 39.99 USD, which contained
the RAMPs 1.4,
a [RepRapDiscount Full Graphics LCD](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller), clone A4988
drivers (with 0.100 ohm current sense resistors), and a
clone Arduino Mega 2650.


I've been planning to build an [MPCNC](https://docs.v1engineering.com/mpcnc/intro/) Primo for a long time. After
brushing up on some of my woodworking skills to make a table, it was finally time to get to the nitty gritty and start
sourcing and building the Primo itself. I had a tight budget and needed fast shipping so I chose the RAMPS 1.4 kit.

## The Build

Assembly of the kit was relatively straightforward. The kit came with 18 jumpers, though only 15 were needed
to [set](https://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4#Drivers) the micro-stepping for the A4988 drivers to the appropriate level (
by populating all the jumper locations). Some headers were bent out of shape, but bending them back by hand worked well.

I power it on... and no display.

## The Problems and Fixes

So through the serial monitor, I can tell that the Arduino Mega is still functional. Flashing Marlin gives me the Marlin
prompt, good. Something else is preventing the display from powering on. I measure the voltage across 5V and GND on the
Arduino: 4.5V. The regulator on this cheap Mega 2560 clone is far too weak.

To try to solve this, I de-soldered the power section of the Mega to prevent any sort of interfering with my new
solution, and then stuck an [LM7805](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/78xx) across the VIN and 5V lanes on the Mega. Not
the best or most elegant solution, but it works for now. 5 volts!

Still no display...

Using the [pinout diagram](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller#Connection) on the
RepRap wiki, I did some continuity testing for the "Smart Adapter" board. Turns out 5V and GND weren't connected to the
display connectors. I soldered in some wires to bypass the PCB, and voila! Backlight and display!

![The RAMPS 1.4 with the polumer fuses removed, replaced with wire leads](/assets/img/2022-06-30-ramps-fuses.jpg)

The polymer fuses on this revision of the RAMPS are infamously bad. They have a tendency to randomly trip, and fail to
trip when they're sorely needed. Because I'm not going to run the RAMPS with heaters, I'm not running a 3D printer,
"just" a CNC machine, so most the electrical risk is gone here. So I've decided to just de-solder the polymer fuses to
avoid any problems with them, and I've replaced them with diode leads. Will these lead survive 5 amps of stepper
current? I'll have to see. I might need to add some more solder.

Don't worry, when I build the enclosure I'm planning to add some automotive fuses to the power switch.
