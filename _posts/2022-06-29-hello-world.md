Hello, World!

Hi! I'm Brian Lu, I'm a student attending Purdue University studying in their First-Year Engineering program, and I'm
aiming to transfer into Computer Engineering.

This is my **muBlog**! It's a "Small Blog for Small Things". There aren't going to be any big posts here like the highly
technical articles on the Shamrock blog, just little thoughts, pictures, whatever I can cobble together. I hope that
what interests me here interests you too! Maybe I can give you some ideas?
